This is my 3rd time making it this far and I feel a little more confident than the other times. I will reflect after completion here as well. 

I've completed this project again. I learned quite a bit about fonts this time that I didn't my last couple of times so that was great. I enjoyed how the pirate theme just came to me as I went. I really enjoyed making this towards the end, but I'm glad to be done.
